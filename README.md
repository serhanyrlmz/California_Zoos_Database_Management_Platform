# CS306 Database Systems Project
## A database and a management platform that might be used for zoos in California
* In this project, I have developed a database system for the management of zoos in California. This database holds information on zoos in California, zookeepers, cages, animals, and attributes of those entities. It was done for the CS306 Database Systems course at SabancÄ± University in Spring 2021-2022. MySQL and phpMyAdmin are used.
* Please refer to the final report for details and better understanding.
